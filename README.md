## Turtle Racer! ##

Simple Python application that allows users to enter a number from 2 - 10. Then the application will show the entered number of turtle racers (each a different color) in an window. The turtles will race and eventually one will win at random. The color of the winner is printed in the terminal window.

The application uses the built in Python libraries "turtle", "time" and "random".
